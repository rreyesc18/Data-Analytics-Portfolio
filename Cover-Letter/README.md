## **Dear Hiring Manager,**  

I am writing to express my strong interest in opportunities related to **data analytics, applied mathematics, and predictive modeling**. As a Mathematics & Computer Science student at **Duke University**, I have developed a deep understanding of data-driven decision-making, statistical modeling, and machine learning techniques. My passion lies in leveraging **data science and quantitative analysis** to uncover insights, optimize strategies, and solve complex problems.  

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have worked extensively with **Python, SQL, R, and Tableau**, applying them to diverse analytical challenges. My experience includes:  

- **Climate Change & Flood Risk Analysis** – Developed predictive models using logistic regression and KNN-based estimation to assess **flood probabilities and expected insurance claim payments**, providing actionable insights for policy and risk management.  
- **Understanding RSA Encryption through Applied Mathematics** – Explored the mathematical foundations of **cryptography**, including modular arithmetic and number theory, demonstrating expertise in theoretical and practical problem-solving.  
- **Machine Learning & Statistical Modeling** – Implemented regression models, A/B testing, and data visualization to analyze trends and make data-driven recommendations.  

Beyond technical proficiency, I bring a **strong work ethic, adaptability, and teamwork mentality**. Whether collaborating on research projects, optimizing data workflows, or leading analysis-driven discussions, I excel in **communicating complex findings** to both technical and non-technical audiences. I thrive in **fast-paced, analytical environments** and am eager to contribute innovative solutions to real-world challenges.  

I am particularly drawn to roles that allow me to **blend mathematics, data science, and strategic thinking** to drive impactful results. My goal is to apply my expertise in a team-oriented environment where I can continue to learn, innovate, and deliver data-driven insights.  

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my **skills, analytical mindset, and passion for problem-solving** can contribute to your team. Please feel free to reach out at your convenience.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to connecting.  

**Best regards,**
